# Stylehub

StyleHub is an online shopping platform that creates a unique online shopping experience that helps users find their perfect fit and see themselves in a way that they've never seen before.

This is an enablement project which I developed to implement the basics of Vue and integrate Vue with Node JS.

The tech stack used in this project is,


## Front-end
Vue

## Back-end
Node

## DB
Mongo

This project does not contain the Composition API of Vue. I will release a new project for that.
